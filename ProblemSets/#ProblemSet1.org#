* Problem 1
  Write a predicate compare which inputs lists a and b of numbers, and which checks
  whether the ith element of a is less than or equal to the ith element of b, for all i
  between 0 and m - 1, where m is the length of the shorter of the two lists.
* Problem 2
  Write a function triples which inputs a positive integer n, and which outputs 
  the list of all 3-tuples (i,j,k) of distinct integers i, j and k, with 1 <= i <= n,
  1 <= j <= n, and 1 <= k <= n. 
* Problem 3
  Write a function triplesSummingToS which inputs a positive integer n and an integer S,
  and which outputs the list of all 3-tuples (i,j,k) of distinct integers i,j and k as in Problem 1, 
  but with the added constraint that i + j + k = S
* Problem 4
  Write a function orderedTriples which inputs a positive integer n, and which outputs the list
  of all 3-tuples as in Problem 1, but with i < j < k.
* Problem 5
  Use the prelude function foldr to write a function flatten, so that 
  flatten [[1],[2],[3]] = [1,2,3], and in general, if x is a finite list of finite lists xi,
  then flatten x is the list consisting of the elements of the xi, in order.   
* Problem 6
  Write a function removeDuplicates which inputs a finite list x and returns a list y which contains
  exactly the elements of x, but with multiplicity 1.  So: removeDuplicates [1,1,2,1,2] = [1,2].
  Do not worry about the order of the elements.  
* Problem 7
  Write a predicate sameElements which inputs two finite lists m and n and checks whether m and n have the
  same elements (perhaps in different order).
* Problem 8
  Write a predicate distinct which inputs a list of numbers and which checks whether all these numbers
  are distinct.
* Problem 9
  Write a function to solve this puzzle.  Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live on different 
  floors of an apartment house that contains only five floors. Baker does not live on the top floor. 
  Cooper does not live on the bottom floor. Fletcher does not live on either the top or the bottom floor. 
  Miller lives on a higher floor than does Cooper. Smith does not live on a floor adjacent to Fletcher's. 
  Fletcher does not live on a floor adjacent to Cooper's. Where does everyone live? (Abelson and Sussman 
  attribute this puzzle to Dinesman)
* Problem 10
  Write a function which lists all distinct ways of placing 4 queens on a 4x4 chessboard so that none of the queens
  is under attack from any of the others.
